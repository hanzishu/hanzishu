Hanzishu Puzzle Input Method


1． Hanzishu Puzzle Input Method

A Chinse character typing method that breaks up Chinese words into Chinese alphabets, and types letters corresponding to the shape characteristics of the Chinese alphabets through standard keyboard to type Chinese word, phrases and sentences.  The shape intuitive method requires almost zero basic knowledge to start, and inlcudes built-in Pinyin for reverse searching and improving while using. One can also practice with the typing exercise courses and do it in one step. (Hint: For “品”, just type “OOO”。)

The following is an illustrative chart of Chinese alphabets to keys mapping.
       

2． Download and install the general purpose Hanzishu input program

After installing the program, all other programs in the computer can use this input method to input Chinese.

   
Windows computer installation: https://github.com/hanzishu/hanzishu/blob/main/installwindows-en.md

Apple computer installation: https://github.com/hanzishu/hanzishu/blob/main/installmac-en.md

iPhone, Android phones and Unix computers: Similar as Windows and Mac computers, but are still under testing. You can use the specific editor as listed in section six and seven.


3．Usage of the general purpose Hanzishu puzzle input method

Before typing, to use the Hanzishu input method, choose “Weasel” for Windows or “Squirrel” for Mac from computer‘s input method menu. Note that the general purpose version uses "Weasel/Squirrel/Rime" platform.

1） Use left and right arrows “<” and “>” to move the candidate word group up and down.

2） Pinyin within the Hanzishu and reverse look up of the Hanzishu code

Hanzishu has built-in Pinyin method. You first type 'z' as an indicator, then type Pinyin. If you want to type Chinese character '森' using the built-in Pinyin, you type 'z' first, then type Pinyin 'sen'. At this time, the editor screen would show "zsen', the candidate characters including ‘森’ are there for you to choose. Next to the ‘森’, the Hanzishu code of 'eki' is listed for your review.

3） Automatic phrase creation

After you type two to 10 words with their full code once without selection in between, you can type them as phrase next time.   You can also use the full code of an existing phrase along with words to create a longer phrase.

4） Deletion of automatic created phrases

If you want to delete a custom-auto-made phrase, you can more the cursor (with up and down arrow keys) to the custom-auto-made phrase, then press Shift+Delete or Control+Delete for Windows computers, and Shift+Fn+Delete for Mac computers.

Note: Current Rime framework has an issue. Sometimes the framework server would not respond to a user's typing. A tempararily method is: Under Windows computer, from File Manager, go to [c:]\Program files(x86)\Rime\hanzishu-weasel-0.15.0\, use mouse the restart 'WeaselServer.exe'. Under Mac computer, first switch to a different input method, then switch back.

4． Components of the Hanzishu puzzle input method

1） Standard

Puzzle input method is based on the national standard of basic components defined in <Chinese Character Component Standard of GB 13000.1 Character Set for Information Processing>, therefore it has the authority and scientificity.


2） Hanzishu puzzle input method's categorization of the Chinese Character basic components (simplified as 'components' in this document)

All components are divided into five large categories and 25 smaller categories, corresponding to 25 upper case letters.

- Direction categories： Open up（凵/U）， Open down（冂/N），Open left（/S），Open right（匚/C）
- Mouth categories： Single mouth （口/O），Up & down mouth（日/B），four mouths（田/Q）
- Leg categories： Human legs（人/A），crossed legs（乂/X），left & right legs（尺/R），separated legs（八/V），three legs（木/M）
- Common shape categories：T shape（丁/T），D shape（刀/D），P shape（卩/P），cliff（厂/F），triangle（厶/G），H shape（艹/H），K shape（长/K）
- Stroke categories：Horizontal lines（E/E），Vertical lines（丨/I），Arc as 1st stroke（丿/J），Pure dots（/W），Mixed dots（丫/Y），L shape（L/L）

5． Method of inputting components in the puzzle input method

1） Input components:

- Chinese word: type the corresponding letters of Chinese alphabets it contains in sequence. （Ex：口：'口'-〉'o'； 吕： '口口'-〉'oo'； 品:'口口口'-〉'ooo'）

- Word phrase: For two word phrases, type first two Chinese alphabets of every word. (例：忠厚: 中心厂日: olfb; 中文: 中文: ox)。 

- Three or more than three words: type first Chinese alphabet of each word。（例：中国人： 中口人: ooa）

2） Rules for breaking up words into Chinese alphabets

- Must break into Chinese alphabets shown in the chart

- Don’t break up strokes that are crossing through each other (ok to break up touch or disconnected strokes). For example： ‘井’ cannot be broken into smaller alphabets; 明 : ‘日’和‘月’; 古 : ‘十’和‘口’

- As few alphabets as possible (If same, choose the one which first alphabet contains more strokes). For example：房 : ‘户’和‘方’ （instead of breaking up into four alphabets）; 夏 : The first alphabet has two strokes instead of just one
   
3） A real example

Steps to type word ‘品’:

- Find first Chinese alphabet ‘口’；
- Type corresponding letter ‘o’；
- If ‘品’ shows up in the candidate list （below the editing field）, choose it with following methods： a) Hit the word; b) Type it corresponding number; c) If it’s the first word in the list, can also hit space bar.
- If‘品’doesn’t show up，please repeat the above for the second and third alphabets until it shows up
- If‘品’ displays in a later position, you can continue to type in more alphabets to make it rank earlier
- The English letters in the editing field that represents ‘品’will be converted to word ‘品’ automatically.
